## Research and Selection of the Project

As I had never tried to collaborate on an Open Source project, this course marked my first contact with the Open Source world. Not really knowing in which direction to start my research of a topic on which I was going to work, I start by reading the guide provided on GitHub for newcomers simply named [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). It seemed like a great point to start the adventure.

After thoroughly reading this article, many helpful resources are showcased towards the end such as [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore/), [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/) and [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/). The last one, "First Timers Only", was of particular help in my search, allowing me to explore other resources such as [First Contribution](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), [Good First issues (.com)](https://goodfirstissues.com/) and [Good First Issue (.dev)](https://goodfirstissue.dev/). 

The first one, First Contribution, is a GitHub repository focused on simplifying and guiding the way beginners make their first contribution on the platform. It allowed me to discover the whole process of the standard "fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request workflow" for the first time.
The two others, on the other hand, have been of real help in discovering several Open Source projects of interest which I will describe below. Through those resources, I've discovered several repositories such as [Lofi](https://github.com/dvx/lofi), [Harvest](https://github.com/tfukaza/harvest) or [Five Fifths Voter](https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Five-Fifths-Voter).

Although those projects were really interesting in my opinion, as "Lofi" was very relevant for me since I use Spotify daily and as "Five Fifths Voter" seemed like a great project to empower equality, they seemed in my opinion a bit too challenging for me, considering it was my first time contributing and that I needed to do a "small" contribution. Thus, I kept browsing the resources providing me with different examples of "beginner-friendly" project, and that's how I finally encountered the project named [Voyager](https://github.com/pulkithanda/voyager-hf).

As described on the repository, Voyager is a space website that can be used as a template in the future for space-related topics. Once again, it is a topic that is of interest to me, as I myself am quite fond of space observation and space related content, like videos. Plus, developing a website is always something that appeals to me since we did not do web development through my engineering degree. Finally, the different issues available seemed reasonable to solve given my current skills. That's why I decided to go for that Open Source project.
