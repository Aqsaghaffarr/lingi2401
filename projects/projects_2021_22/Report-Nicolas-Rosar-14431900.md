# Project selection

Since the number of open-source application that i'm using is really low i decided to browse the internet and ended up finding an issue about Coding-Space.
The project in itself seems quite young and thus only beginning but I find the concept interesting. When i need to learn a language or another
technology, I always find myself in difficulty to create exercice to practice by myself and end up in tutorials videos and so on...

I did my bachelor in High School and had some courses about web development. I think i could bring something to this project and would therefore like to contribute to it.

# Contribution
The issue I choose is the following-one [Fix skeleton loading card](https://github.com/rishipurwar1/coding-space/issues/25).
The description of the issue was quite short and mentionned a problem in the size of the skeleton that take place as loading animation before retrieving the date from a Firebase Database.

I started by analysing the code and the behavior of the UI during the loading state to find a way to solve the issue and improve the user experience. After this I proposed an example of design for the skeleton card and asked for an access to the current database of the project to ensure consistency between the two state of the web pages (before loading data and after loading data). I didn't have to wait long to get a positive response.

As I was in regular contact with the owner of the repository through Github (pull request) and Discord (a server for the community of Coding Space) I was able to respond more precisly to his need. My work has been done over two pull request.
