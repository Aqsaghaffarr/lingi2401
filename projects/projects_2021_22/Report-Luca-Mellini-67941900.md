# Project Selection

Since I'm very new in the world of Open Source, I kind of stuggled finding a interesting project I could bring an usefull contribution. I spent a lot of time just finding the "sector" I wanted to dive into. 

First of all I wanted to give a contribution to a video game I play a lot since years, which is [Osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu). The project is in heavy development, has a lot a contributors, a very complete documentation, but requires a programming language and a Framework I don't master at all. Thereby I couldn't end up finding an issue I could give a contribution to while still feeling myself usefull.

I kept thinking about other projects but then I thought about Python, which is the programming language I used the most all along my schooling but also the one I would like to keep improving myself with.

So I looked for a Python project when a friend of mine ([@RosarNicolas](https://github.com/RosarNicolas), also student for that course) told me about the website [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/) which includes all the issues having the tag "good first issue", sorted by most recent issues.

I finally endend up finding an issue about VerbCalc, a Python library created in order to make calculations from natural language. 

The project is quite new so it doesn't have lots of contributors but I found the concept interesting since it reminds me another course where I had to create my own programming language in which I actually wanted to had such a feature.

I think my knowledge in Python can bring something to this project and I therefore can't wait to work on it.
