# The Project: ## Meshery
I guess you may be wondering and asking yourself, what is Meshery? Right? Well, I won't be wasting your time here to let you go and understand it yourself, I did that or you :). Meshery as defined on their website [mesheri.io](https://docs.meshery.io/project) is, "Meshery enables operators to deploy WebAssembly filters to Envoy-based data planes.", so yes that's basically it, but wait, did you really understood that phrase? Yes?, No...? Well let me explain it in Layman's terms it would be mush easier for you, but for me.. Hmm, not quite easy. After doing some research about this company, I realized how organized their platform is, how did I know? Please, take a look at their github repos [Meshery](https://github.com/meshery), that's only the public ones, maybe they're hiding in their private world much more repos than that! Let me simplify it for you and make you understand a little bit more about what is a service mesh that Meshery has been built upon. Service Mesh, is a method to enable application parts that are not related to each other to be able to communicate. It's like an infrastructure layer that helps service-to-service communicate wisely over a network. A service mesh is a configurable infrastructure layer for micro services application, it provides micro services governance by adding necessary visibility and security controls when you have dozens of services. The service mesh helps discover, authorize, and track the different service instances you have.


## Meshery.io
Meshery.io? Wait, isn't it the same as the above Meshery but with a ".io" decoration at the end? Well... Not really. Meshery.io is the website that the Meshery use to describe and attract users who want to use their service, that's why we see the .io at the end, so I would advise to just take a look at how beautiful and organized their website is at [Meshery.io](https://meshery.io). Now that you made your eyes a little more comfortable while looking at their website, I would like to explain why I chose to work on this project, but not in here, but in the paragraph below. Yeah sorry for making you scroll some pixels down :)


# The Project I Worked on
After doing some research on github and after many failed attempts to contribute in big projects such as NodeJs and Angular since I like to work with these frameworks, it was a little too advanced for me as a contributing beginner, this is why I decided to keep on digging until I find a project that suits my knowledge and I would be able to contribute in and fix issues that developers didn't or don't have the time to, well this is why the "Issues" Tab on github is for right? After using github's advanced search engine, I came up with a search that would help me identify why I am looking for, this search was: "is:open label:'good first issue' language:HTML is:public", I came up with multiple projects and realizing that some projects are too small to contribute in or project owners are not willing or active to see PR that fixes their software issues. This is when I came across Meshery.io, a beautiful and advanced website that fits my needs and that has a community that you can be part of and that helps you on your way if you faced any difficulties while working on their fixes. The fix that I am working on is in the Issue paragraph down below.


# My Motivation
Since I am passionate about the web development world, I am always excited to start working on personal projects or projects that enrich my knowledge in web development. Since contribution in projects is a really good way to be included in a community, I decided to take LINFO2401 and start learning about the contribution world that every passionate developer should be envolved in and at least know how it works and what are the tools needed to be able to contribute in a practical and professional way.


# Issue
I am working on issue #562 found here [Issue #562](https://github.com/meshery/meshery.io/issues/562). As I have experience in the web development world after working on many websites in the past, I was able to read their code and understand the issue that the developer made, which is he used different class name in different orders and some class name was missing in the <a></a> tag. After forking their repo and reading all of their [contributing documentation](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-gitflow.md), I was able to build and run my code locally as described in their documentation, this helped me understand how their code is structured and change things locally so I won't mess with their original website. After spending some time understanding their code and finding where I need to change things, I was able to identify the problem and was able to fix it since I understood where the problem resided. I would like to share more on how I was able to contribute and the community that I worked with at a later stage :).
