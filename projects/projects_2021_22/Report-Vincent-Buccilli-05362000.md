# Project Selection

I was looking for a project that I frequently use during my studies and my management of them. The act I do every day is looking for my courses of the day, 
in my first year at university I used the official website to consult the schedule of my courses on [Horaire UCLouvain](http://horaire.uclouvain.be/direct/index.jsp?displayConfName=webEtudiant&fbclid=IwAR0teCwaqz6ZMITEvkHso2qTCwhixoTrRFpyWtLg5IE5cjbeM1His2jvwds) 
but there are lots of useless informations and the timetable depends on the university handleling. Since this moment, I use another tool that is called [ADE-Scheduler] and 
that allow a total handleling of my courses and my agenda. I think this open project is a good vision of "How does an open project is build" so I decided to choose this one and 
find an issue that I can bring to it. 

## Project history

This project has been made by three students at EPL in order to make the planning handleling more easier for the student community. Lots of features has been implemented since 2019 
and the project receives support from EPL's teachers which allow the project to be hosted on UCL Louvain's servers and allow it to access to the official API of the university.

### Interact with community

Through serverals communication channels like Git and discord, the owners of this project are easily contactable and open to the proposition of grow.

### Contribution processing

The first thing that I needed to do was to set up my environment and the project to be abble to contribute. In order to process this set up, I followed the documentation of [ADE Scheduler](https://ade-scheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). After that I tried to understand 
the architecture of the project and the technologies that have been used to make it. 

The main point of this project was the understanding of the technology and how the app can communicate with the data and the render. Through this way I discovered that some data are getting from the official API of the university,
like the planning of courses, like the list of each places for the courses. I learn that some part of the app was declared in the back end of the app and use in the front-end directly. 
As the API wasn't be modify by students, I decided to look for a contribution in the project-specifics data.

### The contribution

The contribution that I found was motivated by the knowledge of the "La synth√®se soustractive" which is the process that mix the three primary colors (Red - blue - Yellow) to achieve to 
all other shades of color. In the creation of a new slots in the timetable, there are 10 colors available that can be attribute to the slot including red and blue, but the third color in the primary colors is corresponding 
to a shade close to the color "orange". To complete the choices I relpaced the fifth color (That correspond to the yellow one) by a yellow shade that is more smooth (#faf08c) which is adapted to the visibility.
I followed the contribution scheme and first started to open an issue on the git of the project and talked with the owners of the project 

[The issue](https://github.com/ADE-Scheduler/ADE-Scheduler/issues/616) leads to a compromise on the shade of the color and thus I made a [pull request](https://github.com/ADE-Scheduler/ADE-Scheduler/pull/628) and wait for it to be merged.
### Conclusion

During my experience, I learn to use Git tools deeper and learn the way to install and understand a new project with the documentation of the builder. 
The way to communicate with the builders was a good thing to understand the requirements of this project.
