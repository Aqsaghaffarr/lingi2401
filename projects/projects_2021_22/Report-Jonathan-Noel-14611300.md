# Why this project ? <span style='font-size:8pt;'>*(2021/09/19)*</span>

## Ansible 

According to [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) Github repository README, Ansible is :

<cite>"Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy.". </cite>

## Motivation

Python is a programming language that I find very interesting and practical on a daily basis. It was therefore logical that I headed for a project using this language.

I went to Github and started looking for this Python project that I would like to contribute to. In the search list, Ansible showed up and that's when I knew I needed to contribute.
Today, the automation of deployment and maintenance tasks are in full expansion and I find it important to contribute to these DevOps focused projects knowing that they represent, from my point of view, the near future of IT.

# Issue

[Issue #73410](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73410)

Adding an argument to vars_prompt component.
This enhancement allows you to automatically decide whether a value is truthy or falsy and return the associated bool value.
In addition, to go further in development, it would be good to adapt this functionality to various types of data.
