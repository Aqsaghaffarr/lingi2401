# Personal Background

As far as I am concerned, the world of open source is totally unknown to me. During my bachelor studies I didn't put much effort into my studies, and I was often satisfied with doing the minimum for the projects. Today I consider that I have a lot of weaknesses regarding my real computer skills.  Until last year, I had never really participated in computer projects outside of the ones proposed in my courses.

I chose this course because I wanted to take my first step into the world of open source of which I have heard so much.

# Project Selection

As said above, I don't have much experience. The only projects I've done outside of university are mini-games made with Unity and C#, and a mobile application made with react-native. So it's natural that I'm going to focus my research in these directions.

First of all, I went to open source game projects made with Unity. I did some research focusing on games that had an active developer community and I came across the [open-project-1](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=evangelism_global_generalpromo_2020-09-21_open-projects-01-repository). But when I wanted to clone the project I noticed that the project took a lot of space and I had to download a lot of resources, and this discouraged me.

I then turned my search to open source react-native libraries because during my application project, I had used a few. And I thought that it could be a good training to dive into the source code of these libraries. I started looking at the [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps), [react-native-modal](https://github.com/react-native-modal/react-native-modal) and [react-native-slider](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-slider) libraries. But often I got stuck either on understanding the structure of the project or I just got stuck on bug fixing.

Finally, I found the [react-native-select-dropdown](https://github.com/AdelRedaa97/react-native-select-dropdown) library which is not yet too advanced, and is still often updated by the community. This project was made for me!

# Choose a contribution

After analysing the project and its structure, I went to the "issues" section and started looking for which problems I could solve, or which functionality I could add.

I have selected [issue#21](https://github.com/AdelRedaa97/react-native-select-dropdown/issues/21#issue-1032474320) and added the ability to select a second icon that is displayed when the dropdown is open. Currently my pull request has not yet been merged.

# Conclusion

To conclude, I am very happy to have made my first open source contribution, it allowed me to familiarize myself with tools like git. It also gave me the opportunity to dive into the details of some react-native libraries and to realize the magnitude that open source projects can take.
