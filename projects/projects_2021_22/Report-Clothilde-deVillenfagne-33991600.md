## Research and Selection of the Project

I didn't know the open source world so I had no idea what program I would be interested in was open source. I started to look for different projects on the internet, I first thought about the VLC media player application, but when I looked a little bit more I realised that it was a difficult project to access and out of reach for a first open source contact.

After a discussion with an acquaintance, it made me think of notepad++, a text editor I use a lot. He pointed out some options he would like to see on it, so I decided to work on it.

A first approach with the community has been made and it is a community open to everyone and very willing to contribute.
