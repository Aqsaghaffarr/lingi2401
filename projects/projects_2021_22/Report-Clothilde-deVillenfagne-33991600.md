## Research and Selection of the Project

I didn't know the open source world so I had no idea what program I would be interested in was open source. I started to look for different projects on the internet, I first thought about the VLC media player application, but when I looked a little bit more I realised that it was a difficult project to access and out of reach for a first open source contact.

After a discussion with an acquaintance, it made me think of notepad++, a text editor I use a lot. He pointed out some options he would like to see on it, so I decided to work on it.

A first approach with the community has been made and it is a community open to everyone and very willing to contribute.


## Start and difficulty 

As noted above I wanted to add an option to the text editor, when I started working on it I quickly got lost in the different files. Especially since the project is in C++, a language I don't know perfectly, it seemed too complicated to approach the initial idea.

So I went back to the issues already present, I first sorted them by the one that had the most comments. So I started the project, but while I was working I realized that I was overtaken by someone who had submitted a solution to the problem before me.

That didn't stop me and I left to find another issue. 

## Contribution

After several searches, I found an issue that required sorting the functions alphabetically rather than by order of appearance. It took me more time to find where the code was located in all the files than to make the actual modification. 

Being my first contribution to an open source project I chose a relatively easy issue to start familiarizing myself with the environment and the language. 

I made a pull request and I'm waiting to see if it is accepted by the moderator. If it works why not continue the contribution further.
